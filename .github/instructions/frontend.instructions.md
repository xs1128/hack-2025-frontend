This is a simple frontend project developed in a Hackathon. It integrates with a FastAPI backend which is yet to be implemented. The frontend should prevent from using any routing other than a single state variable. Use react-query for all data fetching requirements. Prefer clear and introductory explanations in execution plans in each request. When requested to use mock data, ask for relevant python schemas in typeddict if not provided. All mock requests should be implemented still with react query, but replacing fetch with a promise which resolves to the mock data.
